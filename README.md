# PocketScript

Small interpreted language designed to be a safe, web-embeddable version of javascript. 

## Why PocketScript

I designed this language to be executed in websites. I want to create competitive programming games, where users can run their program against another users. However, I need a language that doesn't compromise safety!

PocketScript is meant to be similar to JS, and you should be able to pick it up quickly if you know JS.
